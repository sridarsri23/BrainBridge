# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide for BrainBridge

## Railway Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Nixpacks (Recommended)
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Railway will auto-detect the project structure using nixpacks

### Option 2: Docker (Alternative)
If nixpacks fails, Railway can also use the Dockerfile:
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your service settings
2. Under "Build & Deploy", select "Dockerfile" as the build method
3. Railway will use the provided Dockerfile

### 2. Add PostgreSQL Database
1. In your Railway project dashboard, click "New Service"
2. Select "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will create a PostgreSQL instance
4. Copy the `DATABASE_URL` from the PostgreSQL service variables

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
In your main service, add these environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_for_jwt_tokens
```

### 4. Deploy
1. Railway will automatically deploy when you push to GitHub
2. The build process will:
   - Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Install Node.js dependencies from `package.json`
   - Build the React frontend
   - Start the FastAPI server

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "uvicorn: command not found"
**Solution**: The configuration files have been updated to use `python -m uvicorn` instead of just `uvicorn`.

### Issue: Nixpacks build fails with "undefined variable 'npm'"
**Solution**: 
1. Try using the Dockerfile instead: In Railway dashboard â†’ Service Settings â†’ Build & Deploy â†’ Select "Dockerfile"
2. Or try the simplified nixpacks configuration in `.nixpacks` file

### Issue: Health check fails after successful build
**Solution**: 
1. Check Railway logs for startup errors
2. The health check path has been changed to `/` (simpler endpoint)
3. Database connection issues won't crash the app anymore
4. Try the startup script approach with `start.sh`

### Issue: Database connection fails
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
2. Check that the PostgreSQL service is running
3. Verify the database URL format: `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname`

### Issue: Frontend not building
**Solution**:
1. Check that all Node.js dependencies are in `package.json`
2. Verify the build script in `package.json` is correct
3. Check the build logs in Railway dashboard

### Issue: Environment variables not loading
**Solution**:
1. Make sure all required environment variables are set in Railway
2. Check that `.env` files are not being used (they won't work in production)
3. Verify variable names match what the code expects

## Files Added for Deployment

- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `Procfile` - Tells Railway how to start the app
- `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python version
- `railway.json` - Railway-specific configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration (Nixpacks)
- `.nixpacks` - Alternative build configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Docker-based deployment
- `wsgi.py` - Alternative entry point

## Health Check

The application includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health` that Railway will use to verify the deployment is working.

## Manual Deployment Test

To test locally before deploying:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install

# Build frontend
npm run build

# Start server
python -m uvicorn server.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to verify everything works.
