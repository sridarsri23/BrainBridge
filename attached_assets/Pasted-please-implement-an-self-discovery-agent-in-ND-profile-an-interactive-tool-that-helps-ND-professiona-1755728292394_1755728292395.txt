please implement an self discovery agent in ND profile an interactive tool that helps ND professional to discover their cognitive strengths, communication styles
I need the agent to be able to assess neurodivergent adults based on the following 
it should do following assessments to asses Sample Cognitive Demand Categories (CDC) category of the ND professional by conduncting following 
Self-Assessment/Quizzes: {quiz_results} (e.g., memory tasks: High, logic puzzles: Medium).
Behavioral Observations: {behavior_data} (e.g., reaction time: Slow, attention tracking: Sustained).
Past Work/Academic: {past_data} (if available).
Map to CDCs (core and additional) and rate strengths: High, Medium, Low.
below are few od CDCs
Focus/Selective Attention, Sustained Attention, Pattern Recognition, Working Memory,
Sequencing, Sensory Load Tolerance (noise/light), Context Switching, Communication
(written/verbal), Social Interaction Load, Motor/Executive Planning, Routine
Preference, Predictability Need.

Output as a vectorized representation (e.g., [Pattern Recognition: High, Multitasking: Low]).
Output in JSON:
{
 "user_id": "uuid",
 "strengths": {"pattern_recognition": 0.88, "sustained_attention": 0.80,
"context_switching": 0.40, "verbal_comm": 0.55},
 "sensitivities": {"noise": "high", "lighting": "medium"},
 "preferences": {"routine": "high", "remote": "preferred"},
 "embedding": "vector://ndsp/uuid",
 "evidence": {"quiz_ids": ["q1","q7"], "work_history": ["SOC L1 1y"]}
}

the strengths can be assessed like 
Core CDCs:
Focus: Sustained attention on tasks.
Pattern Recognition: Identifying anomalies or  patterns.
Verbal Communication: Interacting verbally.
Spatial Reasoning: Handling spatial tasks.
Creative Ideation: Generating ideas.
Multitasking / Context Switching: Handling multiple tasks.
Additional CDCs:
Processing Speed Demand: Quick interpretation, decisions, and actions.
Navigation/Executive Function Demand: Planning, organizing, and adapting in interfaces.
Input Modality/Fine Motor Demand: Physical input methods like typing or speech.
Sensory Processing Demand: Visual, auditory, or sensory UI elements.
Communication Style/Interpretation Demand: Interpreting literal vs. nuanced language.
Focus/Attention Demand: Sustaining attention and filtering distractions. 


backend we are already using fastapi, frontend react(vite), db postgres, please use langchain for agent implementation and gpt for llm and vector db pgvector db.
